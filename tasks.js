-Being able to open the ability to see who viewed their profile if they tweet
or post a comment on facebook - just like how dropbox does it.  Being
able to see who viewed their profile will be a premium model. If they
have not unlocked the feature, then we should tell them how many people
have visited their profile.

Misc:

When someone adds comments on events/activites they are subscribed to send email notification
  // -When someone joins or removes themselves from activity/event

-Being able to see the number of followers on Twitter, number of friends on facebook, and validate from LinkedIn. Go to www.airbnb.com
 and see how the validation works there, once the account is validated
with twitter or facebook, you can see the number of twitter follower and
 facebook friends.

-Being able to flag user profile and photos (UI changes and also functionality).  We also need to notify the owner of the site (me) regarding this.

Uncategorized:

tweet about us, we can give them pre-written tweets.  Follow dropbox on this  (Ui)

- Ability to point over someone and find out more information about them. show persons name, address and snippit of what they wrote in about me first column (if u can fit it).


-Notificatoins (the red on the header of facebook).  We need ot notify them when
someone has viewed their profile, if they received a new message, new
comment on events, activities, someone joined their event or activity.
 Anything that deserves notification or user’s attention then we should
implement it.

 • Add Google plus as a form of validation

• We need a little button on the user profile page to make as flag and also in their profile pictures.

-Can we make the search box a little taller, it just looks wired

-When I click on edit for any of the items, the text box should be bigger to encourage uses to enter more information.  Right now there is only two lines, we should make it 6+ lines. (this might be done now? I think you fixed this.)

-The world icon and the message icons on the headers are not working (not like in the UI).

-The top right of the header where it is suppose to show the name is not working as in UI ( I think he's saying this because he hasn't entered a First Name or last name on his account.)

-Facebook and social media verifications are not working.

-The font on the right hand side of the profile for “Age” “Gender” are not the same as they were before

-The Top 5s are not working the way that was in the designs. ("he's talking about the new design for Top 5 with all the little boxes.")

-Visitors section is not working as we discussed upon.  They should have the option to unlock this feature for a month by tweeting, sharing on Facebook,

The Events Filters are all messed up in UI

Create an Event:
For Timing we should give them option to pick a day range instead of just today or tomorrow.

-There should be an ending time.

-The Event image option just seems out of place for some reason.  We should move this somewhere else.  How about on top of Location map?  This way we keep all the images together

-Description box should be rich text box as in the Designs. The description box UI also needs to be corrected to look more like the mocks.

-For Event Image, we need to make sure the resolution is straight for all of them, the same that goes for profile picture.  This way the image do not look distorted.

For Who can Join/View Event when creating an event:
-For age we need to allow them to have a range
-For Gender options change “All” to “Any”
// -We should let them pick more than one ethnicity
// was not in docs

-We can let them pick education level:
    -“Finished” “University” “Or higher”
    -“Working On” “Masters” “Or Higher”
    -Basically there needs to be three drop downs
// -They should be able to select more than one occupation
// was not in doc

-When clicking on activities, the UI for the activity page needs to be more like the mocks

// -The thumbnail of the host does not show up
// works for me

-Nothing happens when I click interested

-The UI on the messaging list is also messed p
????????

// -I should have a way to remove favorite from the favorites which I do not have right now
// there was no design for this, but cliking on favorited user will take you to his profile where you can remove it from favorites

// -Whenever I am in favorites , the left hand side tab says I am in messaging.

-The UI for favorite also does not match
